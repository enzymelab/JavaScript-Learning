        <h1>The Script Band Bio</h1>
        <p>The story of the band called The Script reads like, well, a movie script! Band members Danny O’Donoghue (lead singer),
        Mark Sheehan and Glen Power come from Ireland, and all three have gone from rags to riches – just like characters in a
        Hollywood film! All three members of The Script started out in inner-city Dublin (a city in Ireland). Danny and Mark tasted some success
        as part of a boy band called My Town. But soon they were struggling again, when the competition from other, similar
        sounds got stiff. Instead of giving up, The Script worked their tails off to make a name for themselves in the music
        business. Now they’re creating their own fairy tale with the success of platinum single, Breakeven, from their
        self-titled album.</p>
